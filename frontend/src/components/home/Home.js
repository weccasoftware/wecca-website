            The Western Engineering Concrete Canoe Association (WECCA) is a team
            of dedicated and innovative students who come together to design,
            build and race a concrete canoe each year. WECCA competes annually
            in the Canadian National Concrete Canoe Competition against over a
            dozen other Universities from across North America. Team members can
            be involved in many different aspects of the project including
            procuring an optimal concrete mix, designing the canoeâ€™s hull
            profile, as well as casting and finishing the final product. WECCA
            provides an excellent opportunity for students to gain technical and
            teamwork skills in a welcoming and inclusive environment.

            Designing a canoe can be challenging, but that has never stopped us. We decided to take it up a
            notch. <br/><br/> <i>Concrete floats our boat, what floats yours?</i>
